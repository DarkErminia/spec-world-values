        <p>This is a 8Values-style test that maps out the "values" of a speculative future setting, mostly ones that are centered around humans, and can be seen as a plausible future for our world. Generally mapping it onto whether it's more optimistic or pessimistic, anthropocentric or cosmically indifferent, etc. The questions should be answered not as what the author personally believes, but instead how the world is in-universe. This was originally made for the Children of Dusk universe.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>The test aligns a world on 9 different axies:</h3>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Optimism VS Pessimism: </strong>Is your future setting more optimistic or pessimistic about the future of the world?</p>
        <p><strong>Material VS Spiritual: </strong>To what extent does this future vision of humanity embrace or reject the ideas of materialism, as in the idea that the universe is primarily made of mechanical matter?</p>
        <p><strong>Purist VS Transhumanist: </strong>Is humanity able to maintain its current form and genetics, or does it diverge into something new and possibly exotic?</p>
        <p><strong>Darwinist VS Idealist: </strong>Possibly reworded as Cynicist VS Idealist, to what extent is the primary driver of this world's future history endless struggles over self-interested power, VS the propagation of higher ideals?</p>
        <p><strong>Homogenous VS Heterogenous: </strong>Does the world converge into one homogenous view of the world, or many, many heterogenous worldviews?</p>
        <p><strong>Isolationist VS Expansionist: </strong>Did the world look more towards inwards perfection, or outwards expansion?</p>
        <p><strong>Traditional VS Progressive: </strong>To what extent is the world still recognizable and stick to its traditions, or did it diverge and become unrecognizable from today? (Culturally)</p>
        <p><strong>Primitivist VS Accelerationist: </strong>How fast did the world change (Technologically)? Is the world still recognizable, or did a singularity change everything?</p>
        <p><strong>Cosmic Indifference VS Anthropocentrism: </strong>Finally, whether the setting aligns more with cosmic indifference, or the power of the indomitable human spirit. HP Lovecraft VS Humanity F--- Yeah.</p>
